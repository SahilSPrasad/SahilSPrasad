## 🚀 About Me

I’m a software engineer with a strong interest in **backend systems, distributed architectures, and scalable services**.  
I enjoy building reliable systems using **Java, Spring Boot, and event-driven architectures**, and I’m always looking to deepen my understanding of system design and performance.

Previously, I worked as a **Software Engineer Intern at Adaptive Biotechnologies**, where I contributed to production microservices used by real-world scientific platforms.
